                            mirror permissions to that ClusterRole, or make the `kvdi-manager`
                            itself a cluster admin, both of which come with inherent
                            risks. In the end, you can decide the best approach for

                            APIs via kvdi sessions."

                          and only turned on taking into account the inherent risks.
                          If the access token used for authorizing actions against
                          the kvdi API gets compromised, it would be relatively easy

                          and use it for authenticating against third-party resources.
                          Additionally, when mapping these values to desktops, they
                          will be stored temporarily in Kubernetes Secrets. The security
                          of those secrets depends highly on your Kubernetes RBAC

                          the Desktop is. So in short, it would be wise to only use
                          this setting in trusted environments where access to the
                          necessary kubernetes APIs is only available to a select
                          group of administrators, and the risk of the user using
